# Angular-To-Do-List
This is an Angular.js to-do list app I made as an example for the Web Development coding camp that I helped teach this summer. This app utilizes the user's local storage to be able to add, delete, and save the data when they return to the page URL within the same browser.

## Programming Skills Used
This single-page application uses Angular.js to create an interactive user experience, taking user actions (inputs) and binding them to corresponding JS functions and objects to change/edit the output. The local storage component uses HTML5's local storage to store/save the changes/edits wihtin the user's current browser.

## To-Do List
I would like to switch from HTML5's local storage to Angular's ngStorage to have complete Angular consistency within the JS code.
